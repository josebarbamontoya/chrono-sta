12 directories for simulated data and two model trees:

      model_supertree_c1-c3.tre -> C1-C3 model supertree (reference tree).
      timetree_collection_c1 -> six MSAs and six constituent timetrees.
      timetree_collection_c1_var_x1 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 1×).
      timetree_collection_c1_var_x2 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 2×).
      timetree_collection_c1_var_x3 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 3×).
      timetree_collection_c2 -> six MSAs and six constituent timetrees.
      timetree_collection_c2_var_x1 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 1×).
      timetree_collection_c2_var_x2 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 2×).
      timetree_collection_c2_var_x3 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 3×).
      timetree_collection_c3 -> six MSAs and six constituent timetrees.
      timetree_collection_c3_var_x1 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 1×).
      timetree_collection_c3_var_x2 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 2×).
      timetree_collection_c3_var_x3 -> six constituent timetrees, with the node time variance for each timetree increased by one (var 3×).
      toy_model_supertree.tre -> toy model supertree (reference tree).
      toy_model_timetree_collection -> five constituent timetrees.
