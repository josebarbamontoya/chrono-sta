	mammal_reference_timetree.tre -> mammal timetree of Álvarez-Carretero et al. (2022) used as refence tree.
	mammal_timetree_collection -> 14 constituent mammal timetrees (Álvarez-Carretero et al., 2022)
	simiiform_hal_timetree -> TT5-HAL timetree used for comparison. 
	simiiform_timetree_collection.tre -> 87 constituent simiiform timetrees from TimeTree Database (Kumar et al. 2022).
